# EnigmaProject
Perfect Emulation of Enigma Project

This Project is a perfect emulation of the Enigma machine, showing the pathing of the characters through the different components and how they are manipulated to produce the encoded output. The buttons in the top left of the screen correspond to the 'typewriter' like interface the original Enigma used. The output (and input for clarification) is displayed in the boxes in the bottom left. The yellow highlighted characters show the forward pathing, and the blue show the pathingafter being reflected by the reflector.

The type of Enigma machine can be changed from the 'File' tab in the menu bar. The M3 enigma has accessed to Rotors I - V.

The plugboard should be input as one consecutive string, with no spaces. Any repeated characters or a string over length of 20 will return an error. All rotors within the settings should be unique; if the same rotor is selected twice in the rotor settings, an error is returned.

Please note that the UI for this project was optimised for a 13-inch Macbook pro, so the graphics/screen may look slightly different on other devices.
