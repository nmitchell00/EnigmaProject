# EnigmaProject
Perfect Emulation of Enigma Project

This Project is a perfect emulation of the Enigma machine, showing the pathing of the characters through the different components and how
they are manipulated to produce the encoded output. The yellow highlighted characters show the forward pathing, and the blue show the pathing
after being reflected by the reflector.

The type of Enigma machine can be changed from the 'File' tab in the menu bar. The M3 enigma has accessed to Rotors I - V.

The plugboard should be input as one consecutive string, with no spaces. Any repeated characters or a string over length of 20 will return
an error.
